  <section class="textblock white">
    <p>Have you seen, touched, or tasted things that are hard and solid?</p>
    <p>Recall the textures you encountered today, and play with them.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="textblock gray">
    <p>Rigid is a sensory record of solidity. From what we saw, touched, and tasted, it seeks the quiet force that keeps a form intact.</p>
    <p>Think of the tension in glass, the chill of metal, the weight of brick. Remember those textures and play with them once more.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="textblock black">
    <p>This archive collects and reconstructs the texture of rigidity. It explores the aesthetics of resistance through unbending lines, unbroken structures, and surfaces that insist on their form.</p>
    <p>Texture is not only something to be touched, it is a shape of feeling.</p>
